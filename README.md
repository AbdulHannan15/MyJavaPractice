This is note book type project which stores things like gorceries,their works etc. In this , I have created three classes.
Class No 1. date=use to store date on which it is saved or updated (store month-day-year)
Class No 2. ToDO_datatype which used as a datatype which hold title , data and data inside it as a string.
Class No 3. TODO_App this class have multiple function like search(by time, by title) , create,delete,update,retrive(CRUD)
It also have function which can uploads data from files.
